Instructions for Compiling and Running:
1. To compile the code you can use the provided Makefile using "make <file [ex. server, client, all]>" command, replace all areas surronded by <> with their appropriate values as shown in their examples.

2. To run the file use the "./<name [ex. server]>" command, this executes the compiled machine code generated from the previous step.

To compile and run the program do the following:
- make server && make client && make clean
- make all & make clean
- make && make clean

Then use either
- ./client
- ./server
- [w/ Valgrind] valgrind --leak-check=full ./client
